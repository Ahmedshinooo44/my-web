 <pre style="background-color:white"> <br> If you have tweens or teens,
 you know 
 about Snapchat. And if you can't figure out how 
 
 it works, you're probably over 25. One of the most popular social media apps out there, Snapchat gives kids and teens what they really want:
 a simple way to share everyday moments while simultaneously making them look awesome. And unlike Fa
 cebook and Twitter, which record and broadcast everything you do, Snapchat uses messages that are meant to di
 sappear (learn more about how they actually don't). Like so many social media apps, Snapchat is a mixed bag,
 so it's a good idea to understand how it works, how your kids use it and how much time they spend on it so you can make sure their experiences are positive.


 In addition to letting you connect with and follow friends, Snapchat offers a lot more cool stuff: games, news and entertainment, quizzes and truly 
 innovative photo- and video-editing tools (so innovative, in fact, it's nearly impossible for grown-ups to figure them out—another reason kids love it).

 Something about snapping, sharing and then forgetting about life's little moments has massive appeal for kids. And for the most part, that's 
 what they use Snapchat for. The app has a lighthearted design, and its photo filters and effects tend toward rainbows and flower crowns. But other 
 features pose some risks: Snap Map lets friends see each other's location on a map, which isn't always safe; Snapstreaks requires kids to exchange messages
 for as long as possible, which is a major time-suck; and Discover offers some age-inappropriate content.
 With your guidance on privacy, safety, social media pressure and marketing, though, Snapchat can be a fun way for teens to connect.

 <b>WHAT IS SNAPCHAT?</b>

 Snapchat is a popular messaging app that lets users exchange pictures and videos (called snaps) that are meant to disappear after they're
 viewed. It's advertised as a "new type of camera" because the essential function is to take a picture or video, add filters, lenses or other effects
 and share them with friends.

 <b>HOW DOES SNAPCHAT WORK?</b>

 All you need to sign up is your name, an email address and your birth date. On Snapchat, users go by a handle, and Snapchatters gravitate toward 
 silly names. To add friends, you can upload your contacts or search for people you know. You can also automatically add someone by taking a picture of their
 "Snapcode," a special QR code unique to each user. After that, things get a little confusing. On Snapchat, photos—not text—usually start the communication.
 To begin a conversation, you tap the big
 camera circle and take a snap. There are all sorts of photo-editing tools (you have to experiment to figure out what they do) as well as
 filters to adorn your images. Once you customize your snap, you can send it to anyone in your friends list or add it to your story, which is a record of the day that your friends can view for 
 24 hours. Snapchat also offers group texting and group stories that everyone in the group can contribute to <b style="background-color:yellow" href="https://www.snapchat.com/" ><a href="https://www.snapchat.com/"><ins>pages manger app</ins></a></b>.<br> </pre>
